                <h2>Developer</h2>
                <p>
                &emsp;At team 7, my role is as a devloper. I ensure deliverables are in working order and ready to be reviewed in a timely manner.
                I enjoy programming to a large degree and take my work very seriously, I try to go above what is expected of me and to ensure software
                is written exactly as specified. Doing my best to remain flexible and steady even in rapidly changing enviroments is basically my job description.
                </p>
                <h2>Personal</h2>
                <p>
                &emsp;I love many things but my favorite things to do include playing videgames, watching cartoons, ready, and hanging out with my friends. 
                Some of my time well spent reviewing interesting coding practice and trying out new and interesting projects. However, the thing I love most in this world is taking cute pictures of my cat.
