                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;I didn't start out in computer science -- right out of high school I went to UF for economics, with the intention of continuing to a PhD and becoming an academic.
                    However, I found myself unsatisfied with my goals and took some time off to get a better feel for what I actually wanted to do.
                    After a few years of working, I finally had the opportunity to come back to school, and chose computer science because of a logic class I had enjoyed at UF.
                    After I graduate with my BS in December, I would like to work full-time as a developer and continue an MS on the side.

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;I mostly play video games these days, either raiding in Elder Scrolls Online or Guild Wars 2, playing Super Smash Bros. Melee, or immersive sims.
                    I also enjoy watching movies, especially older and silent films, as well as reading.
                    When I visit my parents' house I spend a lot of time with my cat, and my partner and I would like to adopt a dog when I finish my degree.
