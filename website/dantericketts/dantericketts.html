                                I am a Junior in the Computer Science Major at FAU. I moved to America from Jamaica in 2015.
                                I didn't really know what to pick with what career i'd do in the future until senior year in highschool when I got interested in coding and decided to stick with it. Recently I've spending my time
                                learning more languages in my free time.
                                Some of my hobbies include gaming,reading and watching shows and recently started getting back into soccer.
