                                I am a Junior in the Computer Science Major at FAU. I moved to America from Jamaica in 2015.
                                I didn't really know what to pick with what career i'd do in the future until senior year in highschool when I got interested in coding and decided to stick with it.
                                Some of my hobbies include gaming,reading and watching shows and recently started getting back into soccer.
