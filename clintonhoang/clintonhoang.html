                <p class="shortBio"> I am a currently in my Senior years of FAU. I've always taking a liking to Computer
                    Science when I was in highschool. I am most interested in AI, database systems, and programming
                    languages such as C++, Python, and many more if it were to present itself to me. My hobbies include
                    gaming and watching cartoons. </p>
                <p class="shortBio"> Although I am interested in AI, database systems, and certain programming
                    languages, I am still very new to the whole developing and would like to learn all there is to know
                    in these Computer Science Field. A little bit more about me is that my family and I have a pet dog
                    named, Shiloh. He is a Long-Haired Minature Dachshund. </p>
