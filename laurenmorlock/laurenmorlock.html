            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p> &emsp;I didn't start out in computer science -- right out of high school I went to UF for economics,
                with the intention of continuing to a PhD and becoming an academic. However, I found myself unsatisfied
                with my goals and took some time off to get a better feel for what I actually wanted to do. After a few
                years of working, I finally had the opportunity to come back to school, and chose computer science
                because of a logic class I had enjoyed at UF. After I graduate with my BS in December, I would like to
                work full-time as a developer and continue an MS on the side. </p>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p> &emsp;I mostly play video games these days, either raiding in Elder Scrolls Online or Guild Wars 2,
                playing Super Smash Bros. Melee, or immersive sims. I also enjoy watching movies, especially older and
                silent films, as well as reading. When I visit my parents' house I spend a lot of time with my cat, and
                my partner and I would like to adopt a dog when I finish my degree.
